/**
 * 4. Change all of your fetch() functions to axios!
 * - axios has already been imported for you within index.js.
 * - If you've done everything correctly up to this point, this should be simple.
 * - If it is not simple, take a moment to re-evaluate your original code.
 * - Hint: Axios has the ability to set default headers. Use this to your advantage
 *   by setting a default header with your API key so that you do not have to
 *   send it manually with all of your requests! You can also set a default base URL!
